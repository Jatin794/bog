				<description><![CDATA[Sam, your link to the &#039;BSD&#039; (supposed FreeBSD) license on this page is outdated and non-specific as to which &#039;BSD&#039; (your text) license you are linking to.

The above link is to the old &#039;4-clause&#039; BSD license, with a note regarding removal of the advertising clause below.

				<description><![CDATA[I was arguing this idea to a few people for the past few days without knowing of this. I don&#039;t know how some people can call something free if the license includes restrictions. That&#039;s the opposite of free.

Anyway, great that someone agrees. I&#039;ll use it without the exclusive copyright line which sort of goes against the spirit of &#039;do what you want&#039;. I hope to see a version 3 or something that ignores exclusive copyright of anything, including the license document. You actually explicitly recognise the right of anyone to copy the license so using the (C) symbol is sort of confusing and misleading. Also I like to not brand anything I say with others&#039; names. 
I can always just write a similar message with my works but since this is already a recognised (:popular) license it would be nice to use it.

				<description><![CDATA[&quot;They cannot “copyright it”; that’s exactly why the WTFPL is not the public domain. Even if they copyrighted a derived work, they wouldn’t be allowed to sue the copyright holders of the original work.&quot;

This would probably be useful if it was covered in FAQ. Great license otherwise, exactly what I was looking for for years now.]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[@Andreas maybe you could ask for permission to rename the license for your own use. :)
I love the license, not the name. I think I will change it to serve my own purposes to something more like this:

				<description><![CDATA[Hi there, splendid license.

I have a question about using the WTFPL. On your FAQ-page (http://www.wtfpl.net/faq/) it says to include the following text in the source code if I want a no warranty clause:

/* This program is free software. It comes without any warranty, to
     * the extent permitted by applicable law. You can redistribute it
     * and/or modify it under the terms of the Do What The Fuck You Want
     * To Public License, Version 2, as published by Sam Hocevar. See
     * http://www.wtfpl.net/ for more details. */

My question is whether after inlucding this text I still must follow step one and two from the &quot;How do I use the WTFPL?&quot;-section of the FAQ page.]]></description>
